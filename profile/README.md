# ðŸ«Ž Cascadia
We're a small team of UTC students recreating the board game *Cascadia* in C++ using Qt, as part of our LO21 project.

The goal: build a playable digital version with drag-and-drop tiles, habitat logic, wildlife scoring, and a clean interface â€” just like the real thing (but with fewer lost pieces).

### ðŸ›  Built with
- C++ & object-oriented design
- Qt for the GUI
- A lot of trial and error

### ðŸŽ¯ Whatâ€™s next
- Solo and multiplayer modes
- Wildlife scoring rules
- Maybe even a cozy soundtrack

Still work in progress â€” but itâ€™s getting there so stay tuned, star the repo, and help us make the forest proud  ðŸŒ¿
