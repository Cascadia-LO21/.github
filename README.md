# 🫎 Cascadia 
> A wild adventure in code, hexes, and C++ glory

Welcome to **Cascadia**, where tiles align, nature thrives, and C++ meets board game magic. We're a team of student developers bringing the award-winning *Cascadia* board game to life — one hexagon at a time — using **Qt** and **object-oriented design** for our LO21 OOP class.

🎯 **Mission:**  
Recreate the strategy and serenity of Cascadia, with drag-and-drop placement, habitat logic, wildlife scoring, and a polished GUI.

🧠 **Tech Stack:**  
- C++ (for crisp logic & performance)  
- Qt Framework (for an interactive, cross-platform UI)  
- Team spirit + snacks (for debugging marathons)

🐻 **Coming soon:**  
- Full solo and multiplayer modes  
- Wildlife scoring animations  
- A *peaceful* soundtrack (optional, not everyone finds scoring peaceful 😅)

Stay tuned, star the repo, and help us make the forest proud 🌿
